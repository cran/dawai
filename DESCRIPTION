Description: In applications it is usual that some additional information is available. This package dawai (an acronym 
      for Discriminant Analysis With Additional Information) performs linear and quadratic discriminant analysis with 
      additional information expressed as inequality restrictions among the populations means. It also computes several 
      estimations of the true error rate.
